  <!-- Ensure network permissions are present for consumers of this library. This prevents "missing permission" warnings
       from SDKs (e.g., Unity Ads) that check for ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE at runtime. App-level manifest should also include
       these, but adding here ensures they are present after manifest merging in all build variants. -->
